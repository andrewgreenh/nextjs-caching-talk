- 1.  Next.js 16 with cacheComponents: true
- 2.  Static pages are cool!
- 3.  Dynamic content (any usage of an async api) only allowed within Suspense boundaries (NEW)
- 4.  Impact
- a. Shell is still served from cache, but rerendered, but is sent first
- b. Content is streamed in later
- 4.  Static content can be marked with "use cache" and cacheLife() so it won't be rerendered again!!!
- 5.  Request deduplication
- 6.  Caching data that can be reused
- 7.  Personalized data
